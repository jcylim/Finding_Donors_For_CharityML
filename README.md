# Finding_Donors_For_CharityML
## Background: 
Finding Donors for CharityML is a machine learning project done for the Supervised Learning lesson in Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. Its main objective is to use, evaluate, and optimize various supervised machine learning algorithms to determine which algorithm will best identify potential donors and reduce cost of sending mails to non-potential donors.  
## Content: 
This project is mainly done on Jupyter Notebook and done in Python. The Python libraries used were Numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
